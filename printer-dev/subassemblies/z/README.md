Ingredients:

310mm (vertical) 2020 extrusion x 2
100mm (horizontal, for motor) 2020 x 2
250mm MGN12 rail x 2
MGN12H linear guide block x 2
250mm lead screw
NEMA23 motor, 8mm output shaft
M5 nuts x 8
M5 bolts x 16
M5 heat set inserts x 4
M3 heat set inserts x 8
KFL08 bearing blocks x 2
16 x M5 roll-in channel nuts
6 x Openbuilds bracket corners and/or other connecting braces and corners
8 x M3 socket head bolts ~8mm to connect the MGN12H carriage blocks to the printed carriage
~20 x M3 bolts ~6mm to connect the rails to the vertical extrusions~
~20 x M3 T nuts to bolt down the rails
T8 lead screw with follower nut
Oldham coupling for lead screw follower
M3 nuts and bolts to connect the oldham and carriage to the lead screw via the follower.
20T and 40T GT2 6mm pulleys, 8mm bore, with grub screws.
~200mm closed loop GT2 6mm belt to connect the pulleys

Optionally, 10 holes worth of https://www.printables.com/model/240337-m3-t-nut-helpers-for-2020-v-slot-extrusion or similar, x 2

Optionally, more printed backets or printed replacements for the openbuilds corners.


Instructions:

Install the heat set inserts in the carriage.

Attach the carriage to the oldham coupling and the lead screw nut to the oldham coupling. Thread the lead screw through the whole assembly.

Slide the 40T pulley over the lead screw above the top of the carriage. Slide the closed loop belt over, too, so it is just hanging from the lead screw.

Loosely bolt the KLF08 bearings to the z-base and z-top prints using M5 bolts and M5 nuts.

Bolt the bottom print to the bottom of the 310mm vertical extrusions using M5 bolts and channel nuts.
The bottom of the print should be level with the bottom ends of the rails.

Lightly mount the rails to the extrusions, using M3 nuts and bolts, bottoming out at the top of the base bracket.
Don't torque them down, let them slide.

Place the carriage on top of the rails, and insert the bottom of the lead screw into the KLF08 bearing on the z-base.

Lightly bolt the z-top to the top of the extrusions, bottoming it out on the top of the rails, and inserting the top of the lead screw into the top KLF08 bearing.The sequence should now be:

z-top
top KLF08 bearing
top of lead screw with pulley and belt on it
lead screw follower nut
oldham coupling
carriage
bottom of lead screw
lower KLF08
z-base

Bolt the carriage print to the MGN12 carriages using M3 socket head bolts. When it moves freely, and the bottom is square, bolt everything down except the 40t pulley.

Mount the 100mm extusions sticking out from the back of the 310mm extrusions. Use brackets to brace them from underneath.

Attach the NEMA23 to the 100mm extusions using the motor mount. It should be able to slide forward and backwards when it is not bolted down.

Secure the 20T pulley to the output shaft of the NEMA23 with grub screws and thread lock.

Slide the motor mount forward so you can pass the closed loop belt over both the pulleys. Now everything can be alligned vertically, and you can secure the 40T pulley to the lead screw with brub screws (and thread lock!).

Attach the whole assembly to the top and middle central 470mm cross-braces of the frame.

Slide the motor mount back, away from the lead screw, and torque down the M5 bolts to add tension to the Z motor coupling belt.
